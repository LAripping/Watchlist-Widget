# Watchlist Widget

***An android app that beautifully displays your IMDB watchlist on a home screen widget!*** 

"Watchlist Widget" is a simple Android application that provides a home screen widget for your IMDB watchlist. A feature that the official IMDB app never supported and probably never will. In a few easy steps, you can have a scrollable widget to pick your next movie from, with posters, ratings and all. 

This app is heavily inspired by "[TV Time](https://www.tvtime.com/)" (formerly "TV Show Time"). Behind the scenes, it uses:

* [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for fetching posters. Read [below](#usage-instructions) how to get your free API key and specify it in the app 
* [Gllide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) image loading and caching library
* [Expandable-fab](https://github.com/nambicompany/expendable-fab) library for a pumped up Floating Action Button (FAB)
* [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) library for fetching IMDB lists
